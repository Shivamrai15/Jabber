## **Jabber** 


Jabber is a chat app built with Next.js and React.js. It looks good thanks to Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. All the messages and data are stored in a Redis database. Media files like documents, images, videos, and audios are kept safe using Uploadthing. NextAuth handles the authentication process, making sure it's secure. And for real-time messaging, Jabber relies on Pusher to keep things instant.
